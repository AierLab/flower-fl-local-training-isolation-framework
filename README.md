# Flower-FL-Local-Training-Isolation-Framework
Welcome to our groundbreaking Federated Learning repository where we redefine the paradigms of distributed machine learning. By segregating the training process from the core Flower framework and leveraging local state dictionaries as the medium for intra-system communication, we've crafted a setup where complex training methodologies can seamlessly integrate without impinging on the native Flower framework logic.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you venture into the repository, ensure your system is equipped with the necessary frameworks to facilitate a smooth experience:

1. **Flower Framework Installation:**
   
   Set up the Flower framework, a foundational element for federated learning. Execute the following command in your terminal:
   
   ```shell
   python -m pip install flwr 
   ```

2. **PyTorch Installation:**
   
   Subsequently, install PyTorch, a powerful library facilitating machine learning and deep learning implementations. Utilize the official guidelines for a hassle-free installation:
   
   ```shell
   python -m pip install torch torchvision
   ```

## Running the Simulation

Our approach separates the model training aspect from the Flower framework, promoting more complex training methodologies without any disruptions. Here's your roadmap to executing the simulation:

1. **Server Startup:**
   
   Traverse to the designated project directory and initialize the server with the following command:
   
   ```shell
   cd path/to/the/folder
   python server_main.py
   ```

2. **Client Main Activation:**
   
   In separate terminals, kickstart the client main instances sequentially with assigned ranks:
   
   ```shell
   cd path/to/the/folder
   python client_main.py --rank 1
   ```
   ```shell
   cd path/to/the/folder
   python client_main.py --rank 2
   ```

3. **Model Main Activation:**
   
   In parallel, launch the model training threads in distinct terminals, providing them with respective ranks:
   
   ```shell
   cd path/to/the/folder
   python model_main.py --rank 1
   ```
   ```shell
   cd path/to/the/folder
   python model_main.py --rank 2
   ```

This establishes a standard simulation setup, orchestrating five concurrent terminals: two hosting `client_main.py`, two accommodating `model_main.py`, and one dedicated to `server_main.py`.
